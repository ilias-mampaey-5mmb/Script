      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Backend development refers to the development of the server-side of web applications, which includes designing and implementing the logic, algorithms, and database management systems that enable the frontend user interface to function. A backend developer is responsible for building and maintaining the server-side of web applications, which is often done using programming languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript.</p>
